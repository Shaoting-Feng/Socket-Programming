# Socket-Programming
This project is used for practice socket programming. It is a commonly used tool for messaging and file transmission on the Internet. In this lab, I built a file transmission system that contains a server and a client using TCP and UDP protocols respectively. I programmed in C++ language. You can refer to https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/ for more useful information.

I set a rather long period of time to close down UDP client sockets(10 seconds), please wait a bit.
